## Bio

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.JPG">

I work as a data scientist at <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/home" target="_blank">Esri</a> focused on developing machine learning models for product and user analytics. I recently finished a M.S. in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics at Cal Poly Pomona, where my thesis explored the performance of deep neural networks combined with Gaussian processes for aircraft detection in aerial imagery. I was advised by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ac_newhorizons/comments/giikrj/for_our_online_final_my_professor_invited_us_to/" target="_blank">Dr. Jimmy Risk</a>. 

Previously I conducted research in computational fluid dynamics at Tulane University under <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/alexanderphoover" target="_blank">Dr. Alexander Hoover</a>, <a href="https://sse.tulane.edu/math/faculty/cortez" target="_blank">Dr. Ricardo Cortez</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Fauci" target="_blank">Dr. Lisa Fauci</a>. Our work investigated optimal mechanics of flying and swimming animals using the immersed boundary method and high performance computing on Tulane's <a href="https://wiki.hpc.tulane.edu/trac/wiki/cypress" target="_blank">giant supercomputer</a>.
