## Bio

<img class="profile-picture" src="me.JPG">

I work as a data scientist at [Esri](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home) focused on machine learning for product and user analytics. I recently finished a M.S. in Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics at Cal Poly Pomona, where my thesis explored the performance of deep neural networks combined with Gaussian processes for aircraft detection in aerial imagery. I was advised by [Dr. Jimmy Risk](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/513445785). 

Previously I conducted research in computational fluid dynamics at Tulane University under [Dr. Alexander Hoover](https://sites.google.com/view/alexanderphoover), [Dr. Ricardo Cortez](https://sse.tulane.edu/math/faculty/cortez) and [Dr. Lisa Fauci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Fauci). Our work investigated optimal mechanics of flying and swimming animals using the immersed boundary method and high performance computing on Tulane's [giant supercomputer](https://wiki.hpc.tulane.edu/trac/wiki/cypress).
